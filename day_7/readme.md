# 🔁 Day 7: Review + Practice Set

Welcome to **Day 7** of my SQL learning journey! Today’s focus was a comprehensive **review** of everything covered so far, paired with a **custom practice set** to reinforce my understanding of core SQL concepts like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions.

This hands-on session helped me reflect on what I’ve learned and apply it through real-world-inspired scenarios.

## 🧠 Main Topics Covered

- 📄 Data retrieval using `SELECT`
- 🧩 Filtering with `WHERE` and logical operators
- 🔀 Sorting results using `ORDER BY`
- 🔗 Combining tables with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- 🧮 Using aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- 📊 Grouping results with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups using `HAVING`
- 📌 Using aliases for readability (`AS`)
- 🎯 Targeted querying with `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT`

## 📖 What I Learned

Today was about **consolidation and reflection**. I practiced queries that required chaining together multiple concepts—like filtering aggregated data, using joins with grouping, and performing analysis on subsets of data. 

This session made it clear how important it is to:
- Structure queries cleanly for readability
- Break down complex problems step-by-step
- Use comments to document your intent
- Double-check logic with `SELECT *` previews before applying filters or aggregations

## ❓ Example Practice Questions

Here are some of the questions I tackled today to reinforce my knowledge:

1. 🔍 Retrieve the names of all customers who placed more than 3 orders in the last 6 months.
2. 📦 Find the total sales amount for each product category, but only show categories with total sales over ₹50,000.
3. 📉 List all employees who have **not** been assigned to any project using a `LEFT JOIN`.

These questions encouraged multi-step problem solving using joins, group filtering, and aggregate analysis.

## 📂 Files Included

- **`data.sql`** – Includes:
  - Schema definitions of all relevant tables (customers, orders, employees, products, etc.)
  - Sample data for realistic querying
  - Practice question prompts embedded as comments for context

- **`queries.sql`** – Contains:
  - Clean and optimized SQL solutions to each practice question
  - In-line explanations and insights on query design
  - Suggestions for alternative approaches or enhancements

## 📝 Summary

Day 7 served as a **checkpoint** in my SQL learning progress — helping me evaluate not just what I know, but how well I can apply it to practical scenarios. This kind of **deliberate review and applied practice** is crucial for becoming fluent in SQL, especially when working with dynamic and interconnected datasets.

Today’s review mimics real-world use cases like:

- 📈 Business reporting
- 📊 Data analytics
- 📦 E-commerce dashboards
- 🧾 Customer order histories
- 🏢 HR or employee data management

🔄 With each query, I’m getting closer to mastering SQL from the ground up.

Happy querying! 🧠💻📊
