# 🔗 Day 11: `FULL OUTER JOIN` — Merging All Matched and Unmatched Data

Welcome to **Day 11** of my daily SQL learning journey!  
Today’s focus was on **`FULL OUTER JOIN`**, a powerful SQL operation that retrieves **all records** from both joined tables — whether they match or not.

This type of join is especially useful when analyzing datasets where you want to retain unmatched records for further inspection, cleanup, or comprehensive reporting.

## 🧠 Main Topics Covered

- 🧩 Understanding `FULL OUTER JOIN` and how it differs from `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` joins
- 🔄 Retaining unmatched records from both tables
- ❌ Handling NULLs in unmatched fields
- 🧾 Use cases of `FULL OUTER JOIN` in real-world data analysis
- 🔍 Filtering and interpreting results from full joins

## 📖 What I Learned

### 🔹 `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Keep Everything, Match What You Can

The `FULL OUTER JOIN` combines the results of both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. It returns **all rows from both tables**, and when there’s no match, the result contains NULLs for the missing side.

**Basic Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
````

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

🔍 This retrieves **all employees** and **all departments** — even if an employee is not assigned to any department, or if a department has no employees yet.

#### 🧠 Key Points:

* Retains **unmatched records** from both tables
* Useful for **data reconciliation** and finding mismatches
* NULLs indicate where a match wasn't found
* May require `COALESCE()` to substitute NULLs with defaults
* Commonly used in **reporting**, **auditing**, or **merging disparate data sources**

## ❓ Example Practice Questions

Here are a few practical SQL challenges I solved using `FULL OUTER JOIN`:

1. 🔍 List all employees and their department names — including unassigned employees and empty departments.
2. 🧾 Retrieve all customers and orders, even if a customer has no orders or an order is missing a linked customer.
3. 🧑‍🏫 Show all students and course enrollments — including students who haven't enrolled and courses with no students.

These exercises are perfect for building reporting views where **completeness of data** is critical.

## 📂 Files Included

* `data.sql` – Contains:

  * Table schemas (e.g., `employees`, `departments`, `customers`, `orders`, `students`, `courses`)
  * Sample INSERTs
  * Practice questions as SQL comments

* `queries.sql` – Contains:

  * Solutions using `FULL OUTER JOIN` logic
  * Explanations of NULL handling and how unmatched data is displayed
  * Alternate suggestions (like `UNION` of `LEFT` and `RIGHT` joins where `FULL OUTER JOIN` is unsupported)

## 📝 Summary

Today's session on `FULL OUTER JOIN` helped me understand how to perform **comprehensive data merges**, even when data doesn’t align perfectly. It’s a crucial tool when working with:

* Incomplete or partially-related datasets
* Auditing systems for mismatched records
* Creating all-inclusive reports
* Data warehousing and ETL processes
