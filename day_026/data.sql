-- ------------------------------
-- Context: A company HR system tracking employees, their departments, salaries, bonuses, and other payroll details.
-- Today‚Äôs practice focuses on mastering SQL operations within a human resources domain ‚Äî including filters,
-- aggregations, JOINs, subqueries, date functions, grouping, and salary analysis.

-- üëá Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. employees
-- 2. payroll
