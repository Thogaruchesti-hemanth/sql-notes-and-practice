-- üìò Day 16: Correlated Subqueries
-- --------------------------------
-- Context: A company tracks employees, their departments, and salaries. 
-- Today‚Äôs practice focuses on **correlated subqueries** ‚Äî subqueries that 
-- reference columns from the outer query and are executed row-by-row.

-- üëá Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. departments
-- 2. employees

-- ===================================================
-- Table: departments
-- ===================================================
