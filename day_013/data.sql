-- üìò Day 13: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
-- -----------------------------------
-- Context: College database with information about students and their enrollments in courses.
-- Today's focus is on combining, comparing, and filtering datasets using:
-- - `UNION`: Combine results from two SELECTs (removes duplicates)
-- - `UNION ALL`: Same as UNION but keeps duplicates
-- - `INTERSECT`: Returns common rows between two SELECTs
-- - `EXCEPT`: Returns rows from the first SELECT that aren't in the second

-- üëá Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. students
-- 2. course_enrollments

-- Table: students

-- üìù Instructions:
-- Write SQL manually for:
-- - Creating the above tables (`CREATE TABLE`)
-- - Inserting the above data (`INSERT INTO`)
-- - Practicing `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` operations

-- üìö PRACTICE QUESTIONS (35):
-- ---------------------------

-- üîπ UNION Basics (Q1‚ÄìQ10)
-- 1. List all unique majors and all unique course codes.
-- 2. Get all unique student names and all unique course codes.
-- 3. Get all distinct years and distinct semesters using UNION.
-- 4. List names of students and grades from enrollments (note: will only work as structure-only sample).
-- 5. Display all unique student_ids from both tables.
-- 6. Combine all majors and semesters into one list using UNION.
-- 7. List all unique email addresses and course_codes.
-- 8. Display all course codes and majors in a single list (ignore duplicates).
-- 9. List student_ids from students and student_ids from enrollments without duplicates.
-- 10. Combine all grades and years as a single list of values.

-- üîπ UNION ALL (Q11‚ÄìQ17)
-- 11. Display all majors and semesters with duplicates included.
-- 12. List all course_codes from enrollments twice using UNION ALL.
-- 13. Combine student names and majors (some names might repeat) using UNION ALL.
-- 14. Show all student_ids from both tables including duplicates.
-- 15. Get list of grades and years allowing repeats.

-- ‚úÖ End of Day 13 Practice
-- Practice how each set operator behaves with duplicate and non-duplicate data.
-- Tomorrow, we will move to: "Day 14: Review + Real-World Query Practice"
