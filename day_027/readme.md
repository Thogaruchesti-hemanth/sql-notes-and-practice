# 🏨 Day 27: Hotel Booking System — Real-World SQL Design & Practice

Welcome to **Day 27** of my daily SQL learning journey!  
Today’s focus was on designing and practicing SQL queries for a **Hotel Booking System**, simulating real-world database modeling and querying.

This exercise helped reinforce key concepts such as **table relationships**, **data normalization**, and **querying for business use cases** like room availability, customer bookings, and revenue summaries.

## 🧠 Main Topics Covered

- 🏗 Designing relational schemas for hotel management
- 🔑 Primary and foreign key relationships across multiple entities
- 🧾 Handling bookings, availability, customers, and payments
- 📆 Date and time filtering using `BETWEEN`, `>=`, `<=`, and `CURRENT_DATE`
- 📊 Generating reports (e.g., active bookings, revenue by room type)
- 📌 Practical data manipulation and retrieval

## 📖 What I Learned

### 🏨 Hotel Booking Schema: A Practical Application

In this project, I created a schema to represent the typical structure of a hotel system. It involved tables such as:

- `hotels` – Basic info about each hotel (name, location, rating)
- `rooms` – Room details, room types, pricing, and capacity
- `customers` – Guest details for bookings
- `bookings` – Reservation information linked to customers and rooms
- `payments` – Transactions made by customers

These tables are **interconnected using foreign keys**, reflecting real-world business logic. I used this structure to explore practical scenarios like:

- Retrieving booking status
- Checking room availability
- Calculating total income
- Listing current guests

## ❓ Example Practice Questions

Here are some realistic SQL questions I tackled today:

1. 🛏️ Find all available rooms in a hotel for a given date range.
2. 📅 List all current bookings for a specific hotel, including guest names and room types.
3. 💳 Calculate the total revenue generated by each hotel.

These queries represent **real-time hotel operations** such as front-desk lookup, customer service views, and management reporting.

## 📂 Files Included

* `data.sql` – Contains:
  - Table creation for `hotels`, `rooms`, `customers`, `bookings`, and `payments`
  - Insert statements with realistic mock data
  - Practice questions as SQL comments

* `queries.sql` – Contains:
  - SQL query solutions for today's practice questions
  - Clear comments explaining the approach and logic
  - Suggestions for optimizing joins and filtering date ranges

## 📝 Summary

Building and querying a **Hotel Booking System** gave me hands-on experience with **real-world data modeling** and **complex SQL queries**. I practiced designing from scratch, understanding entity relationships, and simulating functional requirements.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Practical SQL involves both **schema design** and **query writing**
- Modeling clear relationships upfront simplifies querying later
- Real-world applications like hotel systems require **careful consideration of dates, availability logic, and revenue tracking**

This experience bridged the gap between learning SQL commands and **applying them to solve real business problems** — exactly what makes a database developer valuable.

📅 Up next: **Day 28: Final Capstone Project** — where I’ll apply everything I’ve learned so far to build a complete SQL-driven system from scratch! It's going to be a comprehensive wrap-up of my journey through schema design, querying, joins, aggregations, and optimization.

Let’s finish strong! 💪📊🏁
