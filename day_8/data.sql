-- üìò Day 8: GROUP BY, HAVING
-- --------------------------
-- Context: A sales database for a retail store tracking customers and their purchases.
-- Today‚Äôs practice focuses on using `GROUP BY` to group records and `HAVING` to filter grouped results.

-- üëá Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. customers
-- 2. purchases

-- ===================================================

-- üìù Instructions:
-- Write SQL statements manually for:
-- - Creating the above tables (`CREATE TABLE`)
-- - Inserting the above data (`INSERT INTO`)
-- - Practicing `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` queries

-- 15. List customers who have spent over ‚Çπ5,000 on Clothing.
-- 16. Show customers whose average purchase amount is above ‚Çπ10,000.
-- 17. Find cities where customers have spent less than ‚Çπ5,000 in total.
-- 18. List categories where average purchase amount is greater than ‚Çπ3000.
-- 19. Display customers who have made purchases in more than 1 category.
-- 20. List cities where total number of purchases is more than 3.

-- üîπ Mixed GROUP BY & Aggregations (Q21‚ÄìQ30)
-- 21. For each customer, show min, max, and avg amount of their purchases.
-- 22. Show the total number of purchases made on each date.
-- 23. Count total items bought per customer per category.
-- 24. For each city, find average amount spent per purchase.
-- 25. Show the highest purchase amount per category.
-- 26. Display number of customers whose total spending is below ‚Çπ5,000.
-- 27. For each category, show number of purchases and total revenue.
-- 28. List each customer's total purchases in Appliances.
-- 29. Show how many customers bought from Electronics but not Clothing.
-- 30. Find customers whose purchases include both Clothing and Electronics.

-- üîπ Advanced Analysis (Q31‚ÄìQ35)
-- 31. Rank customers based on total spending (use aggregation logic only).
-- 32. Find the customer who spent the most on a single purchase.
-- 33. Find categories where at least 3 items were sold.
-- 34. Identify customers who spent nothing on Electronics.
-- 35. Find customers who made purchases only in one category.

-- ‚úÖ End of Day 8 Practice
-- Practice writing `GROUP BY` queries first, then add `HAVING` clauses.
-- Tomorrow we will learn about `INNER JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.
