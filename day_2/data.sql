-- ðŸ“˜ Day 2: WHERE Clause, Logical Operators, and Filtering
-- --------------------------------------------------------
-- Context: Employees and departments in a company
-- Today, we are working with employee records and department information in a company setting.
-- You will practice filtering data using the WHERE clause, applying logical operators (AND, OR, NOT),
-- and using comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to retrieve relevant information from tables.

-- ðŸ‘‡ Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. employees
-- 2. departments

-- ðŸ§  Practice Questions 
-- ------------------------------------------

-- ðŸ”¹ 1. Basic Filtering with WHERE and Comparison Operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Find all employees who are above the age of 30.
-- 2. Identify employees whose salary exceeds 70,000.
-- 3. List employees who joined the company after January 1, 2020.

-- 5. Look for employees who belong to the Sales department.
-- 6. Show employees who are not part of the Engineering department.
-- 7. Find all employees whose salary is anything other than 90,000.
-- 8. Who among the employees is named Grace Lee?
-- 9. List all employees except Bob Johnson.
-- 10. Who earns either exactly 60,000 or exactly 75,000?

-- ðŸ”¹ 2. Filtering with AND Conditions
-- ----------------------------------

-- 11. Determine which employees are at least 30 years old and earn at least 60,000.
-- 12. Which employees are both older than 30 and earning more than 70,000?
-- 13. Identify Engineering department employees who earn more than 60,000.
-- 14. Who are the employees hired in or after 2018 and earning 60,000 or less?
-- 15. Identify employees under the age of 40 who make at least 70,000.
-- 16. In the Sales department, who earns no more than 75,000 and is older than 30?
-- 17. Retrieve employees who joined before 2021 but are not in the Support department.

-- ðŸ”¹ 3. Filtering with OR Conditions
-- ---------------------------------

-- 18. Which employees work in either the Support or Management departments?
-- 19. Find employees who are either in the Sales department or joined after 2021.
-- 20. Which employees either earn below 60,000 or joined after 2021?
-- 21. Who earns over 60,000 and is younger than 35, or was hired before 2016?

-- ðŸ”¹ 4. Using NOT Operator
-- ------------------------

-- 22. From the Management department, who earns a salary other than 99,000?
-- 23. List employees who are 35 years old or younger.
-- 24. Who are the employees whose age falls outside the range of 25 to 35?
-- 25. Show employees who did not join the company after 2022.
-- 26. Find Engineering employees who are not younger than 30.
-- 27. Which employees do not earn exactly 55,000 and joined before 2021?
-- 28. Who are the employees not assigned to Sales or Support?

-- ðŸ”¹ 5. Filtering with Multiple Conditions & Precedence
-- ----------------------------------------------------

-- 29. Which employees are older than 30 or who earn under 60,000 while being in Support?
-- 30. Find employees hired after 2020 who either earn more than 50,000 or are younger than 30.
-- 31. Identify employees who joined before 2020 and are older than 35.
-- 32. Find Management employees who joined the company before 2019.
-- 33. Determine employees whose department is 1 and age is not below 30.
-- 34. Retrieve employees where salary is not 90000 and hire_date is before 2021.
-- 35. Which employees earn a salary between 50,000 and 80,000 inclusive?

-- ðŸ”š End of Day 2 â€“ Filter Conditions Mastery
-- Remember: Focus on writing the SQL statements yourself based on this structure.
-- Tomorrow, weâ€™ll build on this with filtering, conditions, and comparisons using WHERE, AND, OR, etc.
