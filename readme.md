# 🔁 Day 14: Review + Real-World Query Practice

Welcome to **Day 14** of my ongoing SQL learning journey!  
Today's focus was on **reviewing previous concepts** and applying them through **real-world-style query practice**. The goal was to strengthen understanding, spot patterns in problem-solving, and simulate business use cases with realistic data.

Practicing real-world queries is an essential part of becoming proficient in SQL. It helps solidify theoretical knowledge and improves your ability to write efficient, readable, and scalable queries.

## 🧠 Main Topics Covered

- ✅ Review of core SQL concepts: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`
- 🧩 Multi-table JOIN logic and filtering
- 📈 Aggregation using `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- 🔍 Real-world data exploration and analysis
- 🧾 Writing clear, maintainable queries with comments and aliases

## 📖 What I Learned

Today, I revisited many of the foundational SQL concepts through real-world practice problems. Here's what I focused on:

### 🔹 Applying Joins in Business Scenarios

I reinforced how different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) are used to pull relational data. It's all about asking the right question and choosing the correct join type.

### 🔹 Aggregating with Purpose

Using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `GROUP BY` helped derive business insights from raw data, such as:

- Total orders per customer
- Average spend per department
- Maximum stock value by category

### 🔹 Filtering with Precision

Used `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and nested queries to filter data meaningfully, especially after aggregation.

## ❓ Example Practice Questions

Here are some real-world-style queries I practiced:

1. 🧾 List all customers who have placed more than 3 orders.
2. 💰 Find the top 5 products with the highest total sales value.
3. 🧍‍♂️ Retrieve employees who haven’t been assigned to any department yet.

These examples simulate real scenarios like analytics dashboards, user segmentation, and inventory tracking.

## 📝 Summary

Day 14 served as a practical checkpoint to apply and evaluate everything I've learned so far.  
By solving real-world problems, I’ve gained:

- A deeper appreciation for well-structured databases
- Improved fluency in writing clean, efficient SQL
- The ability to approach business problems from a data perspective
