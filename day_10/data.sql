-- üìò Day 10: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
-- --------------------------------
-- Context: A company wants to analyze employees and their assigned projects.
-- Today‚Äôs practice focuses on mastering LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN operations to retrieve combined data.

-- üëá Below is the structure and sample data for two tables:
-- 1. employees
-- 2. projects

-- ===================================================
-- Table: employees
-- ===================================================
-- | emp_id | name             | department     | email                 | joining_date |

-- üìù Instructions:
-- Write SQL statements manually for:
-- - Creating the above tables (`CREATE TABLE`)
-- - Inserting the above data (`INSERT INTO`)
-- - Practicing `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` queries

-- üìö PRACTICE QUESTIONS (35):
-- ---------------------------

-- üîπ LEFT JOIN Basics (Q1‚ÄìQ10)
-- 1. Retrieve all employees along with their assigned project names.
-- 2. Get a list of all employees and their project status (if assigned).
-- 3. Show employee names and project names for all Engineering department employees (include those without projects).
-- 4. List all employees with their assigned project start dates.
-- 5. Retrieve employee details even if they are not assigned to any project.
-- 6. Get names of employees and their assigned project names, if any. Show NULL if not assigned.
-- 7. Show a list of all employees with their corresponding project status. Display 'Unassigned' if no project.
-- 8. Display a list of all employees along with project_id (if any).
-- 9. List all employees who joined after 2022 and their current projects (if assigned).
-- 10. Show each employee's name and the project they are assigned to, including those without projects.

-- üîπ RIGHT JOIN Basics (Q11‚ÄìQ20)
-- 11. Retrieve all projects along with the employee names they are assigned to.
-- 12. Show project name, status, and assigned employee email. Include unassigned projects.
-- 13. List all project details along with employee department (if assigned).
-- 14. Display project name and assigned employee name, including unassigned projects.
-- 15. Get all project records and their associated employee joining date.
-- 16. Show all projects and the assigned employee name, even if no employee is assigned.
-- 17. List project_id, project_name, and department of the assigned employee.
-- 18. Retrieve project names and names of employees, including projects with no assigned employees.
-- 19. Get all ongoing or planned projects with their assigned employee info (if any).
-- 20. Show all project names and emails of assigned employees. Include NULLs for unassigned.

-- üîπ LEFT JOIN with Filters and Conditions (Q21‚ÄìQ27)
-- 21. Retrieve employees from the Sales department and the projects they are working on.
-- 22. Get employees not assigned to any project.
-- 23. Show names of employees and their project names where the project is completed.
-- 24. List Engineering employees along with all their projects, if any.
-- 25. Show all employees and projects where the project started after 2023-01-01.
-- 26. Get employees who joined before 2022 and their assigned projects.
-- 27. Find all employees with no assigned project but who joined after January 2023.

-- üîπ RIGHT JOIN with Filters and Conditions (Q28‚ÄìQ32)
-- 28. Retrieve all planned projects and their assigned employee names.
-- 29. Show projects with NULL in `assigned_to`, and try to get employee name (should be NULL).
-- 30. Get all projects along with employee details where the project status is 'Ongoing'.
-- 31. List projects assigned to employees from the HR department.
-- 32. Get project names and names of employees for projects starting before 2023.

-- 34. Show all projects with assigned employee names, but exclude completed projects.
-- 35. Retrieve all employees who don‚Äôt have a project, and all projects without employees (use LEFT + RIGHT JOIN logic creatively).
