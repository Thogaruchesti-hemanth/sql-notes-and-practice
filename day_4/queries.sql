-- ðŸ“˜ Day 4: ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET
-- ----------------------------------------
-- Context: Employees in a company and their salary records
-- Today, we are exploring how to sort data (`ORDER BY`), control the number of returned rows (`LIMIT`),
-- and skip specific records (`OFFSET`). These techniques are essential for building reports,
-- pagination systems, and ranking lists.

-- ===================================================
-- âœ… SCHEMA: Create Tables
-- ===================================================

-- Q1. Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  hire_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Q2. Create the salaries table
CREATE TABLE salaries (
  salary_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_id INT NOT NULL,
  amount INT NOT NULL,
  effective_date DATE NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id)
);

-- Q3. Insert sample data into employees
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, department, hire_date) VALUES
(1, 'Alice Smith', 'Engineering', '2019-03-10'),
(2, 'Bob Jones', 'Marketing', '2020-06-15'),

(9, 'Irene Scott', 'Sales', '2021-05-20'),
(10, 'Jack Turner', 'Sales', '2022-11-03');

-- Q4. Insert sample data into salaries
INSERT INTO salaries (salary_id, emp_id, amount, effective_date) VALUES

(104, 4, 75000, '2023-01-01'),
(105, 5, 68000, '2023-01-01'),
(106, 6, 64000, '2023-01-01'),
(107, 7, 77000, '2023-01-01'),
(108, 8, 55000, '2023-01-01'),
(109, 9, 66000, '2023-01-01'),

-- âœ… End of Day 4 Practice
-- Todayâ€™s focus was all about sorting, limiting, and paginating data efficiently.
-- These are critical for building real-world applications such as dashboards, reports, and APIs.
-- Next: Master `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations to modify existing records.
