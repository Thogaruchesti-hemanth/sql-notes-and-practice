-- ðŸ“˜ Day 6: DISTINCT, COUNT, MIN, MAX
-- ----------------------------------------
-- Context: Online music streaming platform tracking users and the songs they play.
-- Todayâ€™s practice focuses on retrieving unique values and applying aggregate functions
-- to understand trends and user behaviors.

SELECT 
  subscription_type,
  COUNT(*) AS total_users,
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT country) AS countries
FROM users
GROUP BY subscription_type;
